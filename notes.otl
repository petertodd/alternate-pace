			[X] 100% Internal Metrics
				: Should make a better, abstracted internal metrics
				: library.
				:
				: Metrics to a 100 year lifespan should be the goal.
				: Common eeproms these days have data retention lifespans
				: of over 200 years, the 242 pics are 40 years. Software
				: should outlive hardware, and hardware should last damn
				: near forever.
				:
				: 4 bytes for every meter is probably reasonable. For
				: values updating once a second you get a 136 year
				: lifetime before the meter overflows.
				:
				: Endurance of the eeprom is an issue. Counting on getting
				: 100,000 erase/write cycles seems reasonable, most
				: eeproms are characterized for 1,000,000 cycles min,
				: although there can be weird issues, for instance with
				: the internal eeproms on PICs, there are total write
				: limitations erasing adjacent cells.
				:
				: In any case 100 years * 365 days * 24 hours = 876,000
				: hours. So we really should limit our writes as much as
				: poisible. No big deal, but that interfers with the need
				: to avoid losing data on power failures.
				:
				: One solution would be to simply cache writes in memory.
				: The second there is a powerfailure quickly write
				: everything to flash before power dies on us. To prevent
				: corruption two banks of memory would have to be kept
				: with a pointer selecting which one to use. Only after a
				: bank was completely written would the pointer be
				: written. Basic journaling scheme really.
				:
				: Looks like the time to write a page on an eeprom is
				: about 5ms. 
				[X] Hours Meter
					: 4 bytes
					:
					: Actually should be in seconds, not hours. 2^32
					: seconds = 136 years.
				[X] User input meter
					: 5 meters * 4 bytes = 16 bytes.
					:
					: Don't forget to record the number of times metrics is
					: accessed.
				[X] Temperature
					: UPDATE:
					:
					: Recording min/max readings.
					:
					:
					: The DS3231 can measure temperature and provide the
					: result to the PIC. So we could do stuff like record
					: min/max temperatures experienced by the device, or
					: record temperature bins.
					:
					: According to the datasheet temperature is stored as
					: a 10bit, two's complement code with a resolution of
					: 0.25C
					:
					: 1024/4/2 = +-128C
					:
					: More than the whole range the device can operate at. 
					:
					: Given the amount of eeprom available a bin scheme
					: could easilly record every second spent at every
					: temperature.

					: 1.875"x2.25", LDS-AD14RI, digikey 67-1489-nd, $11 each
					:
					: Electrically these displays are kinda interesting. Each
					: segment is 4 leds in series, the rated Vfd for the
					: segments at 10ma is actually 8V, measured at 7.4V The
					: decimal point is again different, and is 2 leds in

						: STP16DP05 - 16-bit shift register with constant

						:
						: The spec sheet rates the current accuracy for an
						: output voltage of >1.3V Given a 9V supply, 9V-1.3V =
						: 7.7V, pretty close to the 8V rated and above the
						: 7.4V measured.
						:
						: At 12V power dissipation would be:
						:
						: (4V x 10ma * 7) + (8V * 10ma) ~= 360mW
						:
						: Say 0.5W to be safe, well under the 1.25W capability
						: at 50C
						:
						:
						: The 4V decimal can be simply connected up like any
						: other segment as the STP16DP05 has a maximum 20V
						: output voltage.

							[X] What's LE?
								: Not totally sure, but it looks like all
								: LE pins should be ganged together.
							[X] Why is DP mA rated at 10ma and segments at 30ma?
